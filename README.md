# 11 Unsupervised ML

Example notebooks for unsupervised ML
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly detection

Advice for the anomaly notebooks:
- the examples use datasets with about 800 MB total volume. If you work on CIP they should be accessible via a shared filesystem.
- the models are a bit more complex and based on torch. It gives a significant speed-up if you can use a GPU. You can select that on the CIP cluster when you launch your process on https://jupyter.physik.uni-muenchen.de
